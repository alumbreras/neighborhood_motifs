% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:

% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig



% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

\section{Introduction}
The popularization of online forums has brought a growing interest on their underlying dynamics. As any other complex system, the dynamic of online forums can be studied at different levels, from the most macro to the most micro. Macro dynamics are, for instance, the evolution of some global properties of the social graph such as its diameter, or its distribution degree. Micro dynamics are, for instance, the triadic motifs that represent local phenomena such as transitivity (friends of my friends are also my friends) and that may explain some macro phenomena.

The study of user behaviours has also brought the attention of researchers. 
An interesting question in online communities is that concerning roles. In sociology, roles are generally seen as the set of expected behaviours that are attached  to a position in the community. Extrapolating the notion of role, some researchers have looked for roles in online forums. Some others have tried to detect the roles and the users who hold that roles.

Roles can also be studied from the macro or the micro perspective. If studied from the macro, we can analyse the number of users, the percentage of replied post, its centrality in the network, and  so forth.

In this paper we present two types of structural patterns adapted to discussion trees. These trees can represent e-mails, forums, etc. Here we will use forum data to illustrate out methodology. 

In this paper, we focus on the analyse of roles at a micro level, and more specifically at the discussion level. We would like to answer the following question: are there different types of users in terms of the kind of conversation they participate in?

Our intuition is that some users like participating in some kind of discussion rather than other. Certainly, an analysis of the textual content will tell us much about a discussion. However, due to the huge diversity of topics, vocabulary, and the difficulty of current algorithms to capture the language subtleties such as humour, irony, or changing contexts, we turn our attention towards the structure of the discussions. More precisely, we analyse the local graph structure in which a user post in embedded, in the hope that this structure will be meaningful since it also reflects the kind of conversation in that part of the thread. Formally, these local graphs are known as neighbourhoods.

The remaining of the paper is as follows. We first discuss about the convenience of the classic neighbourhood definition in dynamic graphs such as discussion trees. Then we introduce two richer definitions that take into account the order and the time. To illustrate the kind of neighbourhoods we obtain in a real forum, we show the neighbourhood census in a Reddit forum. Finally, we apply both neighbourhood definitions to detect clusters of users that tend to appear in the same neighbourhoods.
We close the paper with some suggestions of future research.

	\label{fig:trees}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion trees}
The interactions like those found in an online forum can be modelled, at least, by two sort of graphs. On the one hand, we can create a graph where vertices represent individuals and an edges represent an interaction between two individuals. At the individual level, this graph is suitable for a large set of analysis concerning the centrality of users, the detection of communities, the detection of groups that tend to interact with the same other groups. At the community level we can analyse properties such as the density of the graph, the clustering coefficient or the degree distribution. On the other hand, we can create a separate tree graph for every discussion where posts are represented by the vertices and and edge from one vertex to another indicates that first post is a reply to the second. This allows to analyse things like patterns of time delay between posts \cite{Bhatt2012}.

We can even mix different levels of representations to study the relationship between the properties and dynamics among the different levels \cite{Dorat2007}.

Of course, we are not limited to the study of graphs and some studies take into account the content of the conversations, the cross-posting activity of users, and so forth \cite{Whittaker1998}

The \textit{root} post of the tree is the post that starts the discussion. It is the only post that has no parent. A \textit{leaf} is a post with no replies.
A \textit{branch} of the tree is the shortest path between the root and some of the leafs. Two branches may share their first posts.


Others: \cite{Gaumont2016}

\section{Structural neighbourhoods}
Extending the classic definition of neighbourhood according to which two vertices are neighbours if the distance between them is one, we start by the following definition of \textit{structural neighbourhood}:

\begin{definition}
Given a tree graph $G$, the \textit{structural neighbourhood} of radius $r$ of post $i$, denoted as $\mathcal{N}_i(r)$, is the induced graph composed of all the vertices that are at distance equal or less than $d$ from post $i$.
\end{definition}
% pros and cons
In the context of discussion threads, this definition has two limitations. First,

 the decision on whether to include some post in the neighbourhood is only based on the structural distance, and therefore two posts that are at distance $d\leq r$ are considered neighbours of $i$ regardless of the time they were written. In conversations, time plays an important role, therefore this is an important limitation. Another consequence of looking only at the structure is that the number of possible neighbourhoods within a radius $r$ is infinite. This poses a problem when trying to categorize conversations since many conversations, while structurally different, can be considered semantically equivalent.

\section{Structuro-temporal neighbourhoods}
As we have discussed, structural neighbourhood falls short in the analysis of conversational structures. Instead, we propose two new definitions of neighbourhood that take into account order and time in which posts are written. 

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{order_neighbourhood}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{breakpoints}
\caption{Illustration of order-based (left) and time-based (right) neighbourhoods. Grey nodes represent the ego post. Nodes with circles are those in the neighbourhood. Numbers indicate the order of the post. The order-based neighbourhood has parameters $r=3$, $n=6$. In the time-based neighbourhood, horizontal changepoints (yellow) and vertical changepoints (orange) represent posts that are temporally far from their predecessors (siblings or parents) and therefore set the limits of the neighbourhood.}
\label{fig:cutpoints}
\end{figure*}
\subsection{Order-based}
Our first definition is based on the order in which posts are attached to the tree. 
\begin{definition}
Given a tree graph $G$, the \textit{structural-temporal neighbourhood} of distance $d$ of post $i$, denoted as $\mathcal{N}_{i}^T(r,n)$ is the induced subgraph from its structural neighbourhood composed the $n$ vertices that are closer to $i$ in time and for which there exists a path to $i$ in $\mathcal{N}_{i}^T(r,n)$.  
\end{definition}

This definition has two advantages over the \textit{structural neighbourhood}. First, the temporal aspect of the conversation is better taken into account since the neighbourhood only includes posts that are structurally and temporally close. Second, the size of the neighbourhood has an upper bound of $max(\mathcal{N}_i(r)), n)$ thus making the space of possible neighbourhood structures finite.

\subsection{Time-based}
Our second definition uses the real timestamps of posts in order to automatically decide where the boundaries of a given neighbourhood are. We might naively set fixed time-based boundaries for the neighbourhood by only including in the neighbourhood those posts whose timestamp $p_i$ is at distance less than $\tau$ from the ego post $|t_i-t_{ego}|<\tau$. However, the pace at which posts are added to the conversation may be very different between conversations, and even between different parts of the same conversation tree, making it difficult to set a fixed temporal radius $\tau$. Instead, we propose a definition based on the concept of $\textit{local dynamic}$. 

Our definition of \textit{local dynamic} is based on the detection of changepoints in the time stamps of the posts (ref). Given a sequence of consecutive posts in the same branch $b$ of a tree, denoted as $p_s,...,p_e$ we say that they belong to the same vertical dynamic if there is no (vertical) changepoint $p_i$ in $b$ such that $p_1 \prec p_i \preceq p_n$. Similarly, given a sequence of chronologically sorted  siblings $s$, denoted as $p_s,...,p_e$, we say that they belong to the same horizontal dynamic if there is no (horizontal) changepoint $p_i$ in $s$ such that $p_1 \prec p_i \preceq p_n$. 

\begin{definition}
Given an ordered tree $T$, the temporal neighbourhood $\mathcal{N}_{i}^T(r)$ is the maximal subgraph of the structural neighbourhood $\mathcal{N}_i(r)$ where all the posts belong to the same local dynamic than the ego post.
\end{definition}
Now we can outline the complete algorithm for time-based neighbourhood (Algorithm \ref{alg:temporal_neighbourhood}). Figure \ref{fig:cutpoints} illustrate a tree with a set of breakpoints and the temporal neighbourhood for a given node.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{algorithmic}
\REQUIRE Posts tree $g$, vertical breakpoints, horizontal breakpoints, ego post $ego$
\ENSURE Subgraph of $g$ with all vertices in $V(g)$
\STATE Compute structural neighbourhood $\mathcal{N}_i(r)$

  \ENDIF

\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Extraction of time-based neighbourhood}
\label{alg:temporal_neighbourhood}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Colored neighbourhoods}
Once we extract a neighbourhood, we assign colors to their nodes to represent some relevant characteristics. In particular, we assign the red color to the ego post, the orange colour to all other posts written by the author of the ego (to identify re-entries) a white color to the root (if included in the neighbourhood), the yellow color to all posts written by the same author who wrote the parent of ego (to identify, for instances, debates between the ego author and the other author), the grey color to all posts written before the ego and the black color to all posts written after the ego. Since some posts might correspond to several colors, we perform a sequential assignment of colors given by $\texttt{grey, black, orange, ego, yellow, white}$.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{neighbourhood_time_342}
\includegraphics[width=0.19\textwidth]{neighbourhood_time_456}
\includegraphics[width=0.18\textwidth]{neighbourhood_time_501}
\includegraphics[width=0.18\textwidth]{neighbourhood_time_524}
\caption{Illustration of different real structures using different colors for the root (white), the ego (red) and other posts written by the same author (orange) the ego parent and other posts written by the same author (yellow), posts previous to the ego (grey) and posts posterior to the ego.}
\label{fig:cutpoints}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Neighbourhood pruning}\label{sec:pruning}
Although the two proposed definitions limit the neighbour space considerably, we can still find structures whose only difference is that one of them has more leafs hanging from some of the nodes. Thus, we prune every neighbourhood by leaving a maximum of two consecutive siblings of the same color and no children.

\section{Application to Reddit forums}
In this section, we use our definition of structural-temporal neighbourhood to detect different types of users according to the neighbourhoods in which their posts are embedded.

Our dataset consists of all posts from March 2014 to May 2015 of the Podemos forum in Reddit\footnote{https://www.reddit.com/r/podemos}\footnote{I have also the data for \textit{gameofthrones, france, datascience, machinelearning complexsystems, philosophy, twoxchromosomes, trees, sex}}. The Podemos forum was conceived in March 2014 as a tool for internal democracy, and forum members used it to debate ideological and organizational principles that were later formalized in their first party congress hold in Madrid the October 18th and 19th 2014. Nowadays, its members use it mainly to share and discuss about political news.
The forum contains 83,6119 posts spread over 47,803 threads and written by 26,193 users. (see Figure~\ref{fig:podemos_distributions})

\begin{figure*}

\caption{Log-log and cumulative distributions and of posts per user.}
\label{fig:podemos_distributions}
\end{figure*}

 %\noindent\textcolor{red}{\rule{16cm}{1mm}}
\subsection{Neighbourhood census}
In this section we analyse the neighbourhood census of our dataset. A counter for every neighbourhood structure is created the first time we detect them. For every post, we extract its neighbourhood (order-based or time-based) and prune it as explained above (Section~\ref{sec:pruning}). Then check whether it is isomorphic to some of the already seen neighbourhoods. If this is the case, then we increment the counter for the neighbourhood previously seen. Otherwise we create a new entry for the current neighbourhood.

\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{census_orderbased_1}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{census_orderbased_2}
	%\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{census_orderbased_3}
	\caption{Most frequent order-based neighbourhoods with $r=2$ and $n=4$}
	\label{fig:census_orderbased}
\end{figure*}

The census obtained with both type of neighbourhood are similar for the most frequent structures? That means that both kind of neighbourhoods are isomorphic for the most popular discussion structures.

%In this section we will build a matrix $M$ for one of the forums of Reddit and then we will cluster users to find groups that have similar preferences over the different types of conversations represented by the neighbourhood structures.

	%\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{neighbourhoods_time_3}
	\caption{Most frequent time-based neighbourhoods}
	\label{fig:neighbourhoods_time}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Conversation-based clustering of users}
In this section we categorize users based on the neighbourhoods of their posts. We limit our study to a set of 100 \textit{active users} who wrote more than 100 posts. For those users, we create an initial feature matrix $U\times N$ where $U$ is the number of users and $N$ is the number of neighbourhoods in the census, and where the the position $(u,n)$ is a counter of the number of times that a post written by user $u$ has a neighbourhood isomorphic to $n$. We drop those feature columns that are zero for every user (these are neighbourhoods seen only around posts of users with low-level activity). To make the feature vector of a user independent on the number of posts, we transform the counts into percentages. And since some features have much higher percentages than others for most users, we scale and normalize the matrix so that every feature has mean 0 and variance 1. To avoid non-significant scores, we remove also the feature column corresponding to neighbourhoods that have a frequency less than 50 among the active users.

We use k-means to find the clusters, though one can use any other clustering method. Since the plot over the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares for $k=1,...20$ did not show any clear elbow we chose $k=3$ clusters so that clusters are easier to interpret. We did the clustering over a feature matrix with order-based neighbourhoods and another feature matrix with time-based neighbourhoods. Figures~\ref{fig:PCA} and shows the PCA projections of the users coloured by their assigned cluster. 


\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{PCA_cluster_orderbased}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{PCA_cluster_timebased}
	\caption{PCA projections of the order-based (above) and time-based (below) neighbourhood features}
	\label{fig:neighbourhoods_time}
\end{figure*}

%Interpretation


% Maybe mention that we can take for instance only the posts before the ego and use it to understand when when can recommend a post based on the structure.

\section{Conclusions}
We presented a method to characterise conversations of users in online threads. Due to the tree nature of online threads, traditional patters such as triads are not able to capture much of relevant dynamics of a conversation. Our defined order-based and temporal-based neighbourhoods 
are able to capture a very rich variety of structures. We used this neighbourhoods to characterise users in terms of the structure of the conversations they participate in and showed that, indeed, there are different types of structural conversationalists

%Future
The concept of structural-temporal neighbourhood opens the door to some interesting paths of research. One might wonder whether other pruning are more pertinent than the proposed here. Also, even after pruning some neighbourhoods suggest the same type of conversation, so a manual merge might be convenient. Maybe sociologists can help to merge the found neighbourhoods in a meaningful way.
